# Who Am I – Personal Portfolio

**Who Am I** is a personal portfolio website built with React, designed to showcase my open-source projects, skills, and online presence. This project serves as a digital identity — a place where others can learn more about who I am, what I’ve built, and where to find me online.

> 🧠 “Not just a portfolio — it's a reflection of the journey so far.”
